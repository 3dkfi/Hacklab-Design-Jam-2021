Doh. It's a text file (in Finnish called tekstifilee).

This is a response to the service design challenge related to Hacklab Mikkeli.

Initial plan
- Create a customer journey for Hacklab 
- Enrich and utilise premade archetypes
- Define and design touchpoints for the journey
- Increase attractiveness, conspicuousness, and commitment 
- Root the solution candidate to design thinking, hacker ethics, and the local hacklab scene

Outcomes
- Actionable plan
- Customer journey with touchpoints and some kind of blueprintish plan
- Rich description
- Touch of overengineering, technical kickailu (as in kikkailu), and hacker ethics (note the fabulous use of the Oxford comma)
